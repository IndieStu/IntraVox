 * A share token only opens IntraVox if it points INTO IntraVox. (SHARE-ROOT)
 *
 * PublicShareService::getShareByToken() checked TYPE_LINK and the expiry date
 * and nothing else, so any link share anywhere in the instance opened every
 * anonymous IntraVox endpoint. A user sharing a holiday photo handed out a token
 * that also read IntraVox pages, media, the page tree, and — through
 * CalendarController::getEventsByShare, a #[PublicPage] — the share owner's
 * calendars, with the caller choosing the calendarIds.
 *
 * The gate decides on the STORAGE ID, not the path. A groupfolder resolved
 * through a member's mounted view reports /<user>/files/<mount> — no
 * __groupfolders segment — so a path-prefix test is per-user and wrong. This is
 * the assumption the P0 floor already caught once; the test below pins it.
