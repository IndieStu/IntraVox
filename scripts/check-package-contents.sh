# check-package-contents.sh — validate a release tarball before it ships.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-package-contents.sh <tarball>
#
# Why this exists: lib/AppInfo/Application.php loads vendor/autoload.php behind a
# file_exists() guard. A tarball built without vendor/ therefore fails SILENTLY —
# enshrined/svg-sanitize and lsolesen/pel are simply absent, and the first SVG
# upload fatals on a missing class (MediaSanitizer catches \Exception, but a
# missing class throws \Error). intravox-2.2.0.tar.gz shipped exactly this way:
# 906 entries, 0 under vendor/.
#
# The mirror-image failure is just as bad: shipping the dev tree, which drops
# phpunit and mockery into every end-user install. Build vendor/ with
# `composer install --no-dev` and this script proves both properties.
